# join-queries_task4.sql
This task demonstrates the use of INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN to combine multiple tables and analyze business data using SQL. The Chinook database was used to connect customers, orders, products, and categories.  Joins were applied to identify customer purchase behavior, calculate product and category-wise revenue, and find customers with no orders.
